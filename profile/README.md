Northern countries, such as Canada, host the majority of the world's remaining wilderness; areas of biodiversity, carbon, and natural resource use importance. However, the north is rapidly changing due to climate, human use, and changing species interactions. As a team, we ask applied questions to better comprehend how wildlife will respond to this change. We integrate information through field work, statistics, and ecological forecasts to ensure sound science behind biodiversity management decisions made today, and in future.
